; local camera offset when free-aim-ing (X: right, Y: up, Z: forward)
offset = (0.65, 0, 0)

; offset when locked-on (comment out to use the value above)
offset-lockon = (1.0, 0, 0)

; automatically disables offset when resting, talking to NPCs, etc.
auto-toggle = yes

; offset interpolation speed when turning (set to 0 to disable interpolation)
interpolation-speed = 15

; offset the camera in the direction your character is moving (0: disabled)
look-ahead = 0.8

; if >= 0 and look-ahead > 0, multiply view space velocity z (forward) component with this value instead of the value above
look-ahead-z = -1

; multiplier to how much the lock-on target can move on-screen before the camera turns to follow
target-aim-area-multiplier = 0.5

; lock-on target offset from center of the screen (set to 1 to disable)
target-view-offset-multiplier = 0.75

; offset the lock-on target to the opposite side of your character
use-offset-on-target = no

; allow the camera to move between either side of your character when locked-on
dynamic-lockon-offset = no

; how fast the camera return to max distance when there's no longer any collisions
collision-springback-speed = 5
